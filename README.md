Bookmarklet for rapid prototyping css grid
==========================================
  
Pretty much copied and pasted from the gist you see here:  
  
[https://gist.github.com/1232664][gistlink]  
  
but already embedded in an html page as a link so you can just drag this into your bookmarks bar.  
  
Also, cleaned up some of the quotes, and turned a couple of the double quotes into html entities to keep from causing parser errors when embedded as a link
